# SPED Evidence Loop

## Product requirements and implementation handoff

**Document status:** Build-ready MVP specification  
**Primary audience:** Product owner, designer, and implementing Codex agent  
**Initial setting:** Preschool special-education classroom  
**Source workflow:** A paper data sheet containing student-specific objectives, repeated session columns, and a shared `4/3/2/1/0/ND` support rubric

---

## 1. Product summary

SPED Evidence Loop is a private classroom data-collection application. A teacher creates student profiles and measurable goals. Classroom assistants record one rubric score for each goal during a selected session. The application organizes those observations, shows progress over time, and creates a teacher-reviewable monthly summary for parent conversations.

The application also allows a teacher to assign a teaching strategy to a goal for a defined period. Assistants see the active strategy while scoring and record whether it was used as planned. The dashboard can then describe how outcomes differed across strategy periods, while clearly avoiding unsupported claims that a strategy caused an improvement.

### Product promise

Replace repetitive paper scoring and manual month-end review with a fast, traceable workflow:

`Set up student -> define goals -> assign strategies -> record sessions -> review progress -> prepare monthly summary`

### MVP success statement

An authorized assistant can score all active goals for one student in under one minute, and a teacher can understand a month of progress without manually reviewing individual paper sheets.

---

## 2. Current workflow and problem

### Current workflow

1. The teacher creates a paper data sheet for each student.
2. The sheet lists the student's current objectives.
3. During each session, an assistant circles or marks one value from `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`, `0`, or `ND` for each objective.
4. At the end of the month, the teacher reviews the sheets manually.
5. The teacher talks through progress with the student's parents or guardians.

### Problems to solve

- Paper records take time to create, collect, organize, and interpret.
- Dates, scorer identity, and session context may not be captured consistently.
- Month-end patterns are difficult to see quickly.
- A score does not currently show which teaching strategy was active or whether it was implemented.
- It is difficult to distinguish lack of progress from inconsistent strategy use.
- Parent-facing summaries require substantial manual preparation.

---

## 3. Source scoring model

The attached sheet uses the following rubric. The MVP must preserve these categories and their meanings.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `4` | Child performs the skill independently or when given a group direction. No adult intervention is needed. |
| `3` | Adult points, gestures, or models and verbally directs the child to perform the skill. |
| `2` | Adult provides partial physical assistance; the child completes some of the skill independently. |
| `1` | Adult provides full physical assistance to complete the skill. |
| `0` | Child does not perform the skill in that opportunity, such as refusing, walking away, ignoring the adult, or saying no. |
| `ND` | No data was collected for that goal in that session. |

### Important analytics rule

The rubric is an **ordered set of support levels**, not a precise equal-interval measurement. The dashboard must prioritize:

- Score distribution
- Median score
- Percentage of valid observations at each level
- Percentage independent (`4`)
- Percentage meeting a teacher-defined threshold
- Change over time
- Number of valid observations

The application must not silently treat `ND` as zero. `ND` is excluded from score calculations and reported separately as missing or unavailable data.

### Configurability

The default rubric is shared across the classroom. A later version may support custom rubrics, but the MVP should use one school-configurable rubric to prevent accidental inconsistency between students.

---

- Internal student identifier generated by the application
- Active/inactive status
- Optional teacher-only notes

Optional information, added only when there is a demonstrated need:

- Preferred name
- Pronouns
- Enrollment dates
- Parent-facing display name

The MVP must not require a diagnosis, date of birth, home address, medical history, or full IEP.

### Goal

---

## 8. Daily scoring interface requirements

### Goal card

Each active goal is displayed as one card:

```text
Following directions

Current strategy
Show a visual cue, give the direction once, and wait 5 seconds.

How much support was needed?
[ 4 ] [ 3 ] [ 2 ] [ 1 ] [ 0 ] [ ND ]

Was the strategy used as planned?
[ Yes ] [ Partly ] [ No ] [ N/A ]

[ Add context or note ]
```

### Interaction requirements

- Score buttons must show the rubric description on tap, hover, or a persistent legend.
- The interface must be usable on a phone or tablet.
- Touch targets must be large and keyboard accessible.
- A selected value must be visually unambiguous and not depend only on color.
- Submission must warn when an active goal has no score.
- `ND` must require a reason selected from:
  - No opportunity
  - Student absent
  - Goal not observed
  - Session interrupted
  - Other
- Notes must be optional.
- The application must not default a goal to `0`.
- The application must not default strategy fidelity to “used as planned.”
- A submitted session receives a visible confirmation.

### Context tags

Optional, configurable tags:

- Student absent for part of session
- Schedule changed
- Substitute staff
- Unusually noisy environment
- Materials unavailable
- Student appeared tired or unwell
- Session interrupted
- Other

Context tags support interpretation but do not change scores automatically.

---

## 9. Strategy tracking design

### MVP model

Each goal may have no more than one active **primary strategy** at a time. This avoids ambiguous comparisons. Supporting techniques can be described inside the strategy instructions.

Every scored observation stores:

- Active strategy assignment ID
- Strategy version
- Fidelity status: full, partial, not used, or not applicable
- Optional fidelity note

### Example

**Goal:** Follow one- to two-step directions.  
**Strategy A:** Verbal direction only.  
**Strategy B:** Visual cue, one verbal direction, and five-second wait time.

Strategy A is active from October 1 through October 14. Strategy B is active beginning October 15. The dashboard shows separate descriptive summaries for the two periods. Observations where the strategy was not used are visible but are not included in a high-fidelity strategy summary by default.

### Strategy comparison requirements

For each strategy period, show:

- Date range
- Number of valid observations
- Number of `ND` entries
- Score distribution
- Median score
- Percentage independent (`4`)
- Percentage meeting the goal threshold
- Fidelity distribution
- Session types represented

The comparison panel must display “insufficient data” until the configurable minimum number of valid, high-fidelity observations is reached.

The interface must use wording such as:

> Scores were higher during the period when Strategy B was assigned and documented as used.

It must not automatically state:

> Strategy B caused the student to improve.

### Teacher decision record

At review time, the teacher can choose:

- Continue strategy
- Modify strategy
- End strategy
- Return to previous strategy
- Collect more data

The teacher may add a rationale. This decision is separate from calculated statistics.

---

## 10. Dashboard requirements

### Classroom dashboard

Show:

- Students with data entered today
- Students still missing expected sessions
- Recently submitted sessions
- Goals needing teacher review
- Strategy review dates approaching

Do not rank students against one another.

### Student dashboard

Show:

- Student display name
- Reporting period selector
- Active goals
- Latest score and date
- Valid observation count
- `ND` count
- Median score
- Percentage independent
- Percentage meeting target
- Active strategy
- Data-completeness indicator

### Goal detail dashboard

Required visualizations:

1. **Timeline:** One point per valid observation, with `ND` displayed separately rather than at zero.
2. **Rubric distribution:** Counts and percentages for `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`, and `0`.
3. **Strategy timeline:** Shaded or labeled periods showing strategy assignment changes.
4. **Fidelity summary:** Full, partial, not used, and not applicable.
5. **Observation table:** Date, session, score, strategy, fidelity, scorer, and note.

Required filters:

- Date range
- Session type
- Strategy period
- Strategy fidelity
- Scorer

### Accessibility and interpretation

- Charts must include readable tables or text alternatives.
- Color must not be the only encoding.
- Every percentage must show its denominator.
- Every summary must state the number of valid observations.
- Small sample sizes must be visible.

---

## 11. Monthly summary requirements

The monthly summary is a teacher-facing draft, not an automatically finalized parent report.

For each goal, include:

- Goal description
- Reporting dates
- Number of valid observations and `ND` entries
- Score distribution
- Median score
- Percentage scored `4`
- Percentage meeting the target
- Strategies used during the period
- Strategy-fidelity summary
- Teacher-entered interpretation
- Teacher-entered next step

Example factual draft:

> During October, 18 valid observations were recorded for following directions, with 2 sessions marked no data. The most frequent score was 3, and 6 of 18 observations were scored 4. The visual-cue strategy was documented as fully used in 11 of 14 applicable observations.

The system may create draft prose from structured statistics. It must not invent explanations for progress or regressions.

Export formats:

- Printable web view in MVP
- PDF after the web report is stable
- CSV for authorized research or analysis workflows

---

## 12. Functional requirements

### Authentication and workspace

- **FR-001:** Users must authenticate before accessing student information.
- **FR-002:** A user may access only the classroom workspace and students assigned to that user.
- **FR-003:** Teachers can invite, deactivate, and assign assistants.
- **FR-004:** Deactivating a user must preserve historical authorship.

### Student and goal management

- **FR-010:** Teachers can create, edit, archive, and restore student profiles.
- **FR-011:** Teachers can create, edit, pause, archive, and reorder goals.
- **FR-012:** Goal changes must be versioned or recorded in an audit history.
- **FR-013:** Archived goals remain visible in historical reports.

### Session scoring

- **FR-020:** Assistants can create a session for an assigned student.
- **FR-021:** Each active goal accepts exactly one of `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`, `0`, or `ND` per session.
- **FR-022:** `ND` is stored separately from numeric values and requires a reason.
- **FR-023:** The active strategy and implementation reminder are visible during scoring.
- **FR-024:** Strategy fidelity is recorded separately from the outcome score.
- **FR-025:** Submission records scorer, created time, and last-edit time automatically.
- **FR-026:** Duplicate submissions for the same student, session type, date, and scorer trigger a warning.
- **FR-027:** Edits preserve the previous value, editor, timestamp, and reason.

### Strategies

- **FR-030:** Teachers can create and version strategy templates.
- **FR-031:** Teachers can assign one primary strategy to a goal for a date range.
- **FR-032:** Overlapping active primary-strategy assignments for one goal are prohibited.
- **FR-033:** Ending or modifying a strategy does not alter historical observations.
- **FR-034:** Teachers can record a strategy-review decision and rationale.

### Dashboards and reporting

- **FR-040:** Teachers can view classroom, student, and goal dashboards.
- **FR-041:** `ND` entries are excluded from numeric calculations.
- **FR-042:** Statistics display their valid observation count.
- **FR-043:** Teachers can filter data by date, session, strategy, fidelity, and scorer.
- **FR-044:** Teachers can generate an editable monthly summary.
- **FR-045:** Reports preserve the source date range and data version.

### Audit and data management

- **FR-050:** Sensitive create, view, update, export, and archive events are logged.
- **FR-051:** Teachers can export a student's records.
- **FR-052:** Record deletion or retention operations require teacher authorization and leave an administrative record where legally appropriate.

---

## 13. Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-001 Performance:** A scoring screen should load within two seconds under normal school connectivity.
- **NFR-002 Resilience:** Draft session data should survive an accidental refresh or brief connectivity loss.
- **NFR-003 Accessibility:** Target WCAG 2.2 AA for the application interface.
- **NFR-004 Security:** Encrypt traffic in transit and database/storage at rest.
- **NFR-005 Authorization:** Enforce access on the server for every student-scoped request; hiding controls in the interface is insufficient.
- **NFR-006 Traceability:** Every displayed statistic must be reproducible from stored observations.
- **NFR-007 Privacy:** Collect only information necessary for the defined classroom workflow.
- **NFR-008 Portability:** Teachers can export data in a documented format.
- **NFR-009 Time handling:** Store timestamps in UTC and display them in the classroom's configured timezone.
- **NFR-010 Browser support:** Support current school-managed Chrome, Edge, and Safari browsers plus tablet layouts.

### Data-model constraints

- Store `ND` as `score = null` plus `no_data_reason`, never as numeric zero.
- Snapshot goal and strategy versions on historical records.
- Prohibit overlapping active primary strategies for the same goal.
- Do not hard-delete users referenced by observations.
- Scope every table and query to the owning workspace, directly or through a validated relationship.

```

---

## 16. Analytics definitions

For a selected goal and period:

```text
valid_observations = observations where score is 0 through 4
no_data_count = observations where score is null
score_distribution[n] = count(valid_observations where score = n)
median_score = median(valid_observations.score)
independence_rate = count(score = 4) / valid_observation_count
target_rate = count(score >= configured_target) / valid_observation_count
full_fidelity_rate = count(fidelity = FULL) / count(applicable strategy observations)
```

Requirements:

- Do not calculate a rate when the denominator is zero.
- Display numerator and denominator with every rate.
- Treat means as optional secondary information, not the primary progress claim.
- Keep observations visible when strategy fidelity is low, but exclude them from “used as planned” strategy summaries.
- Do not run significance tests or causal models in the MVP.

---

## 17. Privacy, safety, and governance

Before using real student data, the product owner must work with the school or district to determine authorization, consent, contractual, retention, and security requirements. Requirements vary by school, jurisdiction, and deployment model.

MVP safeguards:

- Develop and demonstrate with synthetic students first.
- Require authenticated staff accounts.
- Minimize personally identifiable information.
- Apply role-based and student-level access checks server-side.
- Prohibit advertising and unrelated commercial use of student information.
- Do not use student records to train general-purpose models.
- Define retention and deletion procedures before a live pilot.
- Log access, exports, and edits.
- Provide a method to correct records without hiding history.
- Use vetted infrastructure and document every subprocesser before deployment.
- Keep AI or third-party model calls disabled for real student records until the school has reviewed the data flow and contracts.

This document is a product specification, not legal advice.

---

## 18. AI scope

No generative AI is required for the first usable release. The core value comes from structured data capture, strategy history, analytics, and reporting.

After the core workflow is validated, AI may be added to:

- Draft a factual monthly narrative from calculated statistics
- Rewrite teacher-approved text into parent-friendly language
- Help a teacher turn an objective into a concise goal title
- Retrieve an existing, teacher-approved strategy from a controlled library

AI output requirements:

- Generated text must be labeled as a draft.
- The teacher must approve it before export.
- Every numeric statement must come from deterministic application calculations.
- The model must receive only the minimum necessary information.
- The model must not diagnose, modify an IEP, infer causes, or invent observations.
- Prompt, model, source-record IDs, output, edits, and approval must be logged.

---

## 19. MVP implementation plan

### Milestone 0: Product validation

- Observe the existing paper workflow.
- Confirm whether one column represents a day, session, or observation opportunity.
- Confirm how many sessions are typically recorded per student per day.
- Confirm whether the rubric is identical for every classroom and goal.
- Confirm who is allowed to view, correct, and export records.
- Create synthetic sample data covering at least three students and five goals.

**Exit criterion:** The teacher validates a clickable or paper prototype of the scoring workflow.

### Milestone 1: Local application foundation

Recommended stack:

- Next.js and TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma or Drizzle ORM
- Zod validation
- Accessible component library and Tailwind CSS
- Vitest for unit/integration tests
- Playwright for end-to-end tests

Build:

- Application shell
- Local development environment
- Database migrations
- Authentication abstraction
- Seed data
- Test framework

**Exit criterion:** A developer can start the application, sign in as a seeded teacher or assistant, and run all tests.

### Milestone 2: Student, goal, and team setup

Build:

- Student list and profile
- Goal creation and status management
- Teacher/assistant roles
- Assistant-to-student assignments
- Default rubric display
- Audit events for configuration changes

**Exit criterion:** A teacher can configure a student and goals and assign an assistant.

### Milestone 3: Session data collection

Build:

- Mobile-first scoring screen
- `4/3/2/1/0/ND` input
- `ND` reasons
- Draft persistence
- Submission and duplicate warning
- Edit history
- Session list

**Exit criterion:** An assistant can score all active goals and submit a complete session in under one minute during usability testing.

### Milestone 4: Dashboard and reports

Build:

- Student overview
- Goal timeline and distribution
- Observation table and filters
- Monthly structured summary
- Printable report

**Exit criterion:** All displayed statistics match independently calculated test fixtures, and the teacher can prepare a monthly review without reading every individual entry.

### Milestone 5: Strategy tracking

Build:

- Strategy library
- Strategy versioning
- Dated goal-strategy assignment
- Fidelity entry
- Strategy timeline and descriptive comparison
- Teacher review decision

**Exit criterion:** Historical observations retain the correct strategy version, and comparison summaries never mix `ND` or low-fidelity observations into high-fidelity results.

### Milestone 6: Pilot hardening

Build and verify:

- Authorization and tenant-isolation tests
- Accessibility review
- Retention and export workflows
- Backup and restoration process
- Error monitoring without exposing student content
- School-approved deployment and privacy documentation

**Exit criterion:** The school authorizes a small, time-limited pilot with named staff, defined students, and a documented support and incident process.

---

## 20. Acceptance tests for the vertical slice

The first build is successful when all of the following are true:

1. A teacher creates a synthetic student with three goals.
2. The teacher assigns one strategy to one goal.
3. An assistant assigned to that student sees the student; an unassigned assistant does not.
4. The assistant records one session with scores `4`, `2`, and `ND`.
5. The `ND` entry requires a reason and is excluded from numeric summaries.
6. The assistant records whether the active strategy was used.
7. The dashboard shows two valid scores and one `ND`, not three numeric scores.
8. The teacher changes the strategy on a later date.
9. Earlier observations retain the earlier strategy and version.
10. The teacher can see score distributions for each strategy period.
11. Editing a score creates an audit event containing old and new values.
12. The teacher generates an editable monthly factual summary.
13. The assistant cannot change goals, strategies, users, or approved reports.
14. No screen ranks one student against another.

---

## 21. Testing requirements

### Unit tests

- `ND` exclusion
- Median for odd and even observation counts
- Score distribution
- Target and independence rates
- Strategy-period date boundaries
- Fidelity filters
- Permission predicates

### Integration tests

- Teacher creates student, goal, strategy, and assignment
- Assistant submits and edits a session
- Historical strategy version is retained
- Monthly report uses the correct period
- Cross-workspace and unassigned-student access is rejected

### End-to-end tests

- Teacher setup journey
- Assistant mobile scoring journey
- Teacher dashboard review
- Strategy change and comparison
- Monthly report creation and approval

### Usability tests

Observe at least one teacher and two assistants using synthetic data. Measure:

- Time to complete one session
- Wrong-score corrections
- Missed goals
- Confusion between `0` and `ND`
- Confusion between outcome score and strategy fidelity
- Whether the strategy reminder is understandable during classroom work

---

## 22. Open decisions for the product owner

These decisions should be answered with the teacher before a live pilot, but they do not block a synthetic-data prototype:

1. Does one paper column represent a calendar day, a classroom session, or one observation opportunity?
2. Can a student have multiple scored sessions per day?
3. Is the `4/3/2/1/0/ND` rubric universal across the school?
4. Should assistants see historical charts, or only the scoring interface?
5. How long may an assistant edit a submitted entry?
6. Which `ND` reasons match the classroom's language?
7. What is the minimum number of observations before showing a strategy comparison?
8. Does a parent report need a district-specific format or signature?
9. What student information is genuinely required beyond a display name?
10. What is the school's required retention period and approval process?

Recommended prototype defaults:

- One or more sessions per day
- One score per active goal per session
- Universal classroom rubric
- Assistants see entry history but not analytics
- Assistants can edit for 24 hours; teachers can correct later with a reason
- Minimum 10 valid, fully implemented observations before highlighting a strategy-period comparison
- Student aliases and synthetic data until school approval

## 23. Instructions for the implementing Codex agent

1. Treat this document as the product specification.
2. Before coding, inspect the repository and preserve existing user changes.
3. Build only the current milestone; do not add unrelated AI, parent portals, diagnosis features, or integrations.
4. Use synthetic seed data and fictional student names.
5. Implement authorization checks server-side from the beginning.
6. Represent `ND` as null plus a reason, never as zero.
7. Preserve goal and strategy history through versioning or immutable snapshots.
8. Use deterministic functions for analytics and cover them with tests.
9. Optimize the assistant workflow for tablet and phone use.
10. After each milestone, run tests and provide the product owner with exact local startup and verification steps.

### First requested implementation

Build Milestones 1 through 3 as a functioning local vertical slice:

- Seeded teacher and assistant roles
- Synthetic student profiles
- Student-specific goals
- Default rubric
- One active strategy assignment per goal
- Mobile session-scoring interface
- `ND` reasons
- Strategy-fidelity selection
- Submitted-session review
- Basic audit history
- Automated tests for permissions and scoring data integrity

Do not add generative AI in this initial implementation.
